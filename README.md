# EP2791 – Security Analysis of Large-Scale Computer Systems  

Welcome to the official repository of **KTH’s course EP2791 – Security Analysis of Large-Scale Computer Systems**.  

This repository complements the course’s KTH Canvas page, the primary platform for assignments and announcements, by providing course materials, the YACRAF calculator tool, and supplemental resources. Course material holds the core teaching content: the lectures subfolder contains video recordings and slides for Phases 0–5 (including 4a/4b). It's also provides examples, runnable walk-throughs that demonstrate each step of the methodology, including sample inputs/outputs for the YACRAF calculator. Supplemental materials adds depth with reference papers, extended notes (e.g., ThreatModeling-LLM.pdf), and additional worked examples. YACRAF calculator tool contains the calculator itself with usage instructions, example scenarios. Please read the ``README.md`` in each directory before proceeding.

To succeed in the course, you are expected to consult both **Canvas page and this GitHub**.
