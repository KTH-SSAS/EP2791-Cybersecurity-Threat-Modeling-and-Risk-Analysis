# EP2791 – Security Analysis of Large-Scale Computer Systems  

Welcome to the official repository of **KTH’s course EP2791 – Security Analysis of Large-Scale Computer Systems**.  

This repository complements the course’s KTH Canvas page, the primary platform for assignments and announcements, by providing course materials, the YACRAF framework GUI, and supplemental resources. Please read the ``README.md`` in each directory before proceeding.

To succeed in the course, you are expected to consult both **Canvas page and this GitHub**.

Not sure if we should submit only the YACRAF results or also a short explanation. An example submission would help.
