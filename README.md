# Cybersecurity Threat Modeling and Risk Analysis 

Welcome to the official repository of **KTH’s courses EP2790 - Security Analysis of Large-Scale Computer Systems, EP2791 – Cybersecurity Threat Modeling and Risk Analysis, and EP279V - Cyber Security Analysis**. The common denominator for these courses that the backbone consits of the **[Yet another cybersecurity risk assessment framework (Yacraf)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00713-y)**. As this name connotes there exist many different frameworks and methods in this space, and Yacraf's ambition is to comprehensively, consistently, and seamlessly combine threat modeling with quantitiative risk analysis, making it a suitable reference point to other specialized initiatives.   

This repository complements the courses' KTH Canvas pages, the primary platform for assignments and announcements, by providing [course material](https://github.com/KTH-SSAS/EP2791-Cybersecurity-Threat-Modeling-and-Risk-Analysis/tree/master/Course-material), the [Yacraf calculator tool](https://github.com/KTH-SSAS/EP2791-Cybersecurity-Threat-Modeling-and-Risk-Analysis/tree/master/YACRAF-Calculator-Tool), and [supplemental resources](https://github.com/KTH-SSAS/EP2791-Cybersecurity-Threat-Modeling-and-Risk-Analysis/tree/master/Supplemental-Materials). Course material holds the core teaching content: the lectures subfolder contains video recordings and slides for Phases 0–5. It also provides examples, runnable walk-throughs that demonstrate each step of the methodology, including sample inputs/outputs for the Yacraf calculator. 
Supplemental Materials is a curated, optional set of resources, organized by YACRAF phase, to help you go deeper on systems, security, and risk (not exhaustive, not required). You’ll also find a worked example that does not use the Yacraf calculator tool, use it to understand each phase’s intent, then apply the Yacraf workflow to your own case. Please read the ``README.md`` in each directory to navigate the content.

To succeed in the course, you are expected to consult both **the Canvas page and this GitHub**.
