## Lectures
In this folder you’ll find links to the **course lecture videos**. Watch them in order (Phase 0 → Phase 5). Each lecture introduces a phase of the Yacraf that you’ll use for the assignement. All lectures were not recorded at the same point in time and extended and complimentary material has been added over time. A red star in the slide deck is indicating where material has been added. The folder also includes the PDF course slides and PNG diagrams of the risk calculator framework and threat modeling language for better readability



- **Lecture 0 — Preliminaries for Cyber Threat Modeling & Risk Analysis → [Lecture video ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_kih95sxw)** 

    In this lecture, we’ll ground YACRAF in conceptual modeling: UML class diagrams define the language (meta-model) and object diagrams capture real-world instances. You’ll see how this mindset underpins every phase that follows. 

- **Lecture 1 — Phase 0 and 1 Scope & Delimitations and Business Analysis → [Lecture video ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_4yxyqknt)**  

    In this lecture, we’ll first fix the system boundary, what’s in, what’s out, key assumptions, and constraints, so later work stays focused. Then we’ll tie security to the business context by clarifying goals, stakeholders, value at risk, and top loss events. 


- **Lecture 1a — Phase 1: Additional Comments → [Lecture video  ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_co9uba1p)** 

    In this lecture, we explain that Phase 1’s output is a short list of loss events with rough magnitudes (how bad it can get).


- **Lecture 2 — Phase 2 System Definition and Decomposition → [Lecture video ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_ze22lm8m)**

    In this lecture, we’ll map the system with DFDs: components, data stores/flows, and trust boundaries. You’ll build a clean inventory of assets and interfaces to expose where data is handled and where it can be exposed.



- **Lecture 3 — Phase 3 Threat Analysis → [Lecture video ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_v2gw2728)**

    In this lecture, we’ll identify threat actors and abuse cases and estimate contact/action probabilities. You’ll turn attacker intent and capability into concrete threat events you can later quantify.



- **Lecture 3a — Phase 3: Additional Comments → [Lecture video ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_e7siw0ke)**





- **Lecture 4 — Phase 4 Attack and Resilience Analysis → [Lecture video ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_0tz0nn66)**

    In this lecture, we’ll link weaknesses to attack paths (trees/graphs) and examine existing/proposed controls. You’ll prioritize vulnerabilities and understand where the system is fragile or resilient.



- **Lecture 4a — Phase 4: MITRE ATT&CK → [Lecture video ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_vj0fg4g3)**

    In this lecture, we’ll use ATT&CK to name techniques, map likely paths, and check coverage of your defenses. You’ll reference the matrix to enrich your attack chains with realistic steps.



- **Lecture 4b — Phase 4: STRIDE → [Lecture video ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_tlec54a6)**

    In this lecture, we’ll apply STRIDE to your DFD elements to surface missing threats. You’ll use it as a structured cross-check so important categories aren’t overlooked.



- **Lecture 5 — Phase 5 Risk Assessment and Recommendations  → [Lecture video ▶](https://play.kth.se/playlist/dedicated/0_eeoaqjho/0_l4e9lww3)**
    
    In this lecture, we’ll aggregate it all: combine likelihood and impact into overall risk, compare protection scenarios, and deliver clear, prioritized recommendations for reducing risk.
