# Course Material

This directory contains the official materials for EP2791, organized into two subdirectories:

- **Lectures**: EP2791 lecture slides and videos, organized by Yacraf phases (0–5). View in order: Lecture 0 (Preliminaries), then 1) Business Analysis, 2) System Definition & Decomposition, 3) Threat Analysis, 4) Attack & Resilience Analysis, 5) Risk Assessment & Recommendations. Filenames match the lecture titles, a consolidated slide deck is available as [EP2790-HT2024_v1-all.pdf](https://github.com/KTH-SSAS/EP2791-Cybersecurity-Threat-Modeling-and-Risk-Analysis/blob/master/Course-material/lectures/EP2790-HT2024_v1-all.pdf).

# Complementary Tools (Beyond Yacraf)

The course is structured in phases, and **YACRAFT is not intended for all of them**.  
For example, it is **not suitable for System Definition and Decomposition**.  
Below is a list of **complementary tools** you can use during this phase.

## Phase 2 – System Definition and Decomposition

In this phase, you will create a **detailed technical specification** of the system.  
Use **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** to describe the system architecture.  [Learn more about DFDs](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/knowledge/software-design/dfd-using-yourdon-and-demarco/)

### Recommended Tools
- [**draw.io**](https://draw.io) – general diagramming and data modeling tool.  
- [**Lucidchart**](https://www.lucidchart.com) – user-friendly diagramming platform (similar to Visio).  
- [**Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool) *(no longer actively maintained)*.  
- [**Threat Dragon**](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/) – open-source tool for threat modeling.
