## Note on the supplemental example (legacy material)
This running example is old course material and does not use Yacraf tools calculator. It’s provided as supplemental inspiration only, to see how one might think through the phases using a more general method, not as a model for grading. It may be outdated or contain errors, so read it critically, cross-check against the current syllabus and Yacraf templates, and use it to understand intent and structure rather than to copy.


## Examples by Phase

For clarity, the example is split into phases. Each phase provides: a link to the walkthrough video, and complementary materials (e.g., DFDs, diagrams, templates).  This example uses a macro Excel (.xlsm) for risk calculations. For details on how to use it, watch the Phase 5 video.

### Phase 0 — Scope & Delimitations
Define the purpose, boundaries, assumptions, and what’s explicitly out of scope.
