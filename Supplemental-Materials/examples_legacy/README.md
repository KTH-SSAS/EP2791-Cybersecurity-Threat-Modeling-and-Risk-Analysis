## Note on the supplemental example (legacy material)
This running example is old course material and does not use YACRAF. It’s provided as supplemental inspiration only—to see how one might think through the phases using a more general method—not as a model for grading. It may be outdated or contain errors, so read it critically, cross-check against the current syllabus and YACRAF templates, and use it to understand intent and structure rather than to copy.

**Note:** Example models may be subject to change during the course. The files in the "original DFDs" folder were created using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). Files with the .xml extension can be opened and edited using the draw.io tool.
