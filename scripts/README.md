# Creating Scripts

To create a new script, create a copy of the `SCRIPT_TEMPLATE.py` file and rename it. Upon boot of the program, a button to run the newly created script will appear in the bottom right corner of the `Setup Views`. The scripts interfaces to the program through different methods in a `ScriptInterface` class, each one explained in the top of the script template. Examples of available methods are: temporarily overriding values, get calculated values, setting a GUI marker to visually mark specific class instances, etc.
