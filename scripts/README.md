# Creating Scripts

To create a new script, create a copy of the `SCRIPT_TEMPLATE.py` file and rename it. Upon boot of the program, a button to run the newly created script will appear in the bottom right corner of the `System Views`. The scripts interfaces to the program through different methods in a `ScriptInterface` class, each one explained in the top of the script template. Examples of available methods are: temporarily overriding values, get calculated values, setting a GUI marker to visually mark specific class instances, etc.

The default scripts found here should mainly be seen as examples of how to use the functionality. Specifically, some of them are not fully finalized and their correctes cannot be guaranteed.
