# Unit tests

**WARNING: Risk of flashing lights as GUI windows are rapidly created and destroyed**

Run the tests by running:

```
python3 test.py
```

The unit tests validate basic functionality of the tool, where it would be preferred to add more tests in the future to encompass a larger portion of the program's functionality.
